Friday SG Live 02 --> Today Agenda

- What is Jenkins ?

- What is Selenium Grid ?


  LOCAL
     - CukesRunner
     		- browser=remote-chrome
     		- Execution will happen one by one, even if SG has available nodes for executions
     		  ( Since execution started from CukesRunner)


     - Maven
     		- browser=remote-chrome
     		- Execution will happen PARALLEL


    How Driver Class decide which browser will use ?

			String browserType="";
            if (System.getProperty("BROWSER") == null) {
                browserType = ConfigurationReader.getProperty("browser");
            } else {
                browserType = System.getProperty("BROWSER");
            }


        Scn 01 -->

        	config.properties
        		browser=chrome

        		mvn test

        		Execution will happen local browser since we did not provide any
        		Parameter from command line to select which browser gonna work


        Scn 02 -->

        	config.properties
        		browser=chrome

        		mvn test -DBROWSER=remote-chrome

        		-D --> Define System Property

        		-DBROWSER=remote-chrome

        		   KEY   = VALUE


        PRACTICE

        	mvn test -Demail=mike@cydeo.com -Dpass=123456

        	email - System.getProperty("email");
        	pass  - System.getProperty("pass");



  REMOTE (Jenkins)
     - Maven
     - System.getEnv();


  BUILD with PARAMS

Question
	- I received the AWS Free Tier limit alert as has exceeded 85% of the usage limit for AmazonEC2, What do I do now?

	Total free usage per MONTH --> 750 hours  --> 12 MONTHS

	One month max 31 DAYS --> that makes --> 31 x 24 --> 744 hours

	That means NO WAY to EXCEED LIMITS --> AS LONG AS you have ONLY one server

	Why you have this message ?

	26 x 24 --> 624 hours

	624 / 750 --> 0.83 --> %85
